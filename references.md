## Datasets
- [Aligned Scores and Performances (ASAP) dataset](https://github.com/fosfrancesco/asap-dataset) - ASAP is a dataset of aligned musical scores (both MIDI and MusicXML) and performances (audio and MIDI), all with downbeat, beat, time signature, and key signature annotations.

## Libraries and Tools

- [Musicautobot](https://github.com/bearpelican/musicautobot) - A Python library for creating AI-generated music using deep learning models. Contains pre-trained models and example notebooks for music generation.
- [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en) - MuseScore is a requirement for Musicautobot library to allow certain features to be available (e.g., MIDI visualization)
- [music24](http://web.mit.edu/music21/) - A Python library for computational musicology, music theory, and generative music. It provides a flexible and powerful toolkit for working with music notation and analysis, as well as tools for generating new musical compositions using machine learning and other techniques.
